tumorHeatmap

R project for the scientific programming exam.

PROJECT 1
Project name: R package for visual comparison of mutational processes in a set of tumors


This project aims to compute the exposure vectors of tumoral genomes and producing a heatmap to visualize the results.

The computation of the exposure vectors is done thanks to the Bioconductor package decompTumor2Sig (citation: Kr"uger S, Piro RM (2021). decompTumor2Sig: Decompose individual tumors to mutational signatures. R package version 2.8.0.)
The heatmap is computed using the function heatmap from the R package stats (authors: R Core Team and contributors worldwide)
